# Project Bellybutton Biodiversity
Through the dashboard and the individual charts, volunteers will be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
